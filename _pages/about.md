Hi, my name is Jingyou (Rose) Rao, and I'm currently a first-year Computer Science PhD student at University of California, Los Angeles working with [Harold Pimentel](https://pimentellab.com/). I'm interested in the study of gene functions and interactions through statistics and machine learning.

Previously, I completed my bachelor's degree programs in Computer Science and Computational and Systems Biology at University of California, Los Angeles.
