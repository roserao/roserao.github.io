Hi, my name is Jingyou (Rose) Rao, and I'm currently a Computer Science PhD student at University of California, Los Angeles working with [Harold Pimentel](https://pimentellab.com/). I'm interested in the study of gene functions and interactions through statistics and machine learning. Currently, I develop Bayesian models for deep mutational scanning data to investigate the genotype-phenotype relationships.

Previously, I completed my bachelor's degree programs in Computer Science and Computational and Systems Biology at University of California, Los Angeles.
